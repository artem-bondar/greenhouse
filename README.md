# Greenhouse

A simple command line program that emulates greenhouse management.

Each turn you can open/close a window, switch ON/OFF humidification device or just skip an hour.
The goal is to keep your temperature between 0°C and 40°C, humidity between 30 and 90.

Try to run your greenhouse as long as you can!

## Controls
